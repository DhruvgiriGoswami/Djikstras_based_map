# Djikstras_based_map
Creating a Djikstras based map where I first connect every point to its 3 nearest points and then after this is done we find the shortest path from A to B.

NOTE - 
All the points are randomly generated and each compilation of this code will generate a different graph.

This is part-1 where I succesfully made 1 point connect to 3 other closest points.

This is part-2 where I succesfully made all the points connect to their 3 closest points.
